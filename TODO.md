- Add automated mosaicking/reprojection helpers so Washington- and US-wide DEM downloads produce ready-to-use GeoTIFF caches.
- Integrate NLCD or building-footprint obstruction models to replace synthetic height assumptions.
- Persist road/terrain caches between runs and surface cache invalidation commands.
- Expand integration tests to exercise the CLI against clipped real datasets once fixtures are curated.
- Implement optional routing against OSRM/GraphHopper for accurate driving times.
